          <span style="font-weight:bold;">Cautionary Tales for All</span><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Microsoft Anti-Spyware is now in v1.0.509. The upgrade's worthwhile. Also Thunderbird 1.0+ brings in-line spell checking (using the Openoffice.org Myspell engine?) but the upgrade breaks older extensions. Ditton of Firefox 1.0+ which works faster but with fewer extensions. And a couple of free Mozilla tweakers...</span><br /><br />Boy! Have I some hot software for you this week. But first, let's take a moment to learn why it's important to upgrade Microsoft Anti-Spyware (Beta). This (for-now) free-to-use security software protects the computer against known spyware, pop-up ads, web site controls attempting to modify the browser default settings. And blocks access to your private (stored) information like browser passwords.<br /><br />Beta update 1.0.509 was necessitated after Microsoft found Anti-Spyware being targeted by a new generation of viruses. Other changes include improving and extending the real-time protection agents and adding new threat categories. From a user perspective the updated version looks better with a more intuitive navigation interface. Manages system resources better. And works faster; both while scanning and updating its signature database. The previous version would seemingly lock-up while updating. Also new is an ability to hide the Anti-Spyware icon from the system tray.<br /><br />Unfortunately in its present form Anti-Spyware alone is not powerful enough. I recently, based on recommendation made in Brian Livingstone's <a href="http://www.windowssecrets.com/050210/" target="_flodr1">Windows Secrets</a> newsletter, added Webroot <a href="http://www.webroot.com/products/spysweeper/" target="_flodr1">SpySweeper</a> to my arsenal. Available as a 30-day trial version, this software uses a subscription model for its personal edition. And includes real-time shields for Internet Explorer (e.g. default startup and Search pages, Favorites, tracking cookies), the Windows Hosts file, monitors memory, and can block spyware installation attempts in real time.<br /><br />Microsoft Anti-Spyware is still missing anti-cookie features. And I depend on a combination of Ad-Aware SE and Spybot Search & Destroy to root out cookies. Surprisingly SpySweeper found a tracking cookie from <a href="http://www3.ca.com/securityadvisor/pest/pest.aspx?id=453073591" target="_flodr1">Brilliant Digital</a> on my computer that the other tools failed to identify. I get quite suspicious of any software (in spite of its presumably best intentions) that detects something so specific that none of the other tools find it.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of web static that Microsoft Anti-Spyware protects only Windows. And by extension Internet Explorer. Yet does nothing for alternate browser like Firefox and Opera. But if you carefully consider the facts, its Internet Explorer that so susceptible to spyware and dangerous ActiveX controls. Using other browsers is a makes for a far safer online experience.<br /><br />Over the past few weeks I've been extensively checking out some free tools. Here's my take on the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ffpreloader/" target="_flodr1">Firefox Preloader</a> that as the name implies preloads the Firefox browser into memory making for a faster startup. You can also customize the browser's settings. And if you prefer unload Firefox while keeping the preloader utility active. I would like to mention that the overall increase using such tweaks is marginal at best. What really controls Firefox startup is the number of extensions that need to be loaded. Unfortunately, in its current form you need a minimum of 4-5 extensions for a decent browsing experience. Power browsers like I have to install up to 7, which has a detrimental effect on the initial startup time.<br /><br />The free Mozilla Knife, developed by Patrick Kolla better known for Spybot Search & Destroy, is Mozilla Thunderbird tweaker to change the default sort order of mailing accounts. Thunderbird creates accounts sequentially But this is not the most logical of groupings. Power users may want to directly modify the PREFS.JS file, but <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/files/tbprefknife.zip" target="_fldwn">Mozilla Knife</a> is for the hesitant.<br /><br />Mozilla Thunderbird fans will be interested to know there's a new 1.0+ build that includes an inline spell checker. While this feature is still nowhere like what Outlook using Microsoft Word as the email editor is capable of. Its a great beginning. However, install this upgrade with caution as it will break any installed extensions; most of which work only with Thunderbird 1.0. You'll need to modify the EXTENSIONS.RDF file and increase the max version number to 1.0+ before you upgrade to the new version. You can also review the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/roadmap.html" target="_flodr1">Thunderbird Roadmap</a> to see what features have been developed, or will be included shortly in this excellent email client.<br /><br />Firefox too is available in a 1.0+ Beta version. And again, this will break most installed extensions and themes when you upgrade. I found out about the incompatibilities the hard way. Just after I installed an RSS feed reader called NewsMonster. This promised me the moon. But effectively trashed my carefully nurtured (from Firefox 0.8) installation. And forced me to delete everything; including my Firefox profile folder and all my settings. Before I could get the browser working again.<br /><br />Ever since Popcorn, my favorite low-overhead email client, became true pay ware. And is only available as a restricted-to-one account demo. I've been looking for a worthwhile alternate. I tried out ePrompter which supports interfacing with web-mail services like Yahoo, Hotmail and Rediffmail. Yet includes annoyances like a screen saver and a very unintuitive interface coupled with a mail reader that often chokes on HTML messages.<br /><br />I recently found JBMail that reads and removes individual messages directly from a POP3 server. It also supports SMTP, SSL/TLS, message attachments and SMTP authentication. Messages are stripped of inline images, scripts and HTML tags. But I noticed this approach destroys the formatting of mails sent from Outlook. <a href="http://www.pc-tools.net/beta/jbmail/jbmail-3.3-beta2.zip" target="_fldwn">JBMail</a> also supports PGP (requires external GnuPG installed).<br /><br />If you use the <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net" target="_flodr1">Gaim</a> multi-service instant messaging client, watch out for incomplete upgrade documentations. There's a new, significantly improved <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLog" target="_flodr1">Gaim 1.1.3</a> out now. However, the download page doesn't mention that this version works only with GTK 2.5 or later. Gaim 1.1.2 works with GTK 2.4. And if you try upgrading only the Gaim core, you will get a runtime error.<br /><br />And to wrap have you hear the rumors of a new Internet Explorer 7 that will supposedly be released in mid-2005. The bad news is that this will work only with Windows XP SP2 and later versions of Windows. I'm hoping that not all Beta sites have taken Microsoft's threats about leaking software builds to heart. We might just strike gold with an early beta. Nothing much is know about the new features planned. But anti-phishing, pop-up blocking, and improved security seem to be cornerstones. The official <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/02/15/373104.aspx" target="_flodr1">IEBlog</a> has more.<br /><br />That's it for this week. More next time. Stay Safe.<br /><br /><a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#105;&#109;&#102;&#114;&#101;&#101;&#108;&#111;&#97;&#100;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#64;&#80;&#104;&#114;&#101;&#97;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#63;&#115;&#117;&#98;&#106;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#61;&#99;&#111;&#108;&#117;&#109;&#110;&#45;&#102;&#101;&#101;&#100;&#98;&#97;&#99;&#107;">&#67;&#108;&#105;&#99;&#107;&#32;&#72;&#101;&#114;&#101;&#32;&#116;&#111;&#32;&#69;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#32;&#77;&#101;</a><br />

          <h3>February 13, 2005</h3>
     
     
     
		<div class="blogPost">
          <span style="font-weight:bold;">Anti-Piracy Score- Torrents: 0 MPAA: 1</span><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">MPAA closes LokiTorrent but P2P universe grows new sites. First Trojan targeting Microsoft Anti-Spyware appears. Firefox / Camino / Safari / Konqueror / Opera IDN vulnerability. Secure transfers with WinSCP and Sourceforge's Project for February 2005 is ClamWin Anti-AntiVirus for Windows</span><br /><br />The Internet's in an <a href="http://www.isohunt.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10235" target="_flodr1">uproar</a>: the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has actually closed down LokiTorrent; one of the more popular BitTorrent search engines. <a href="http://www.lokitorrent.com/" target="_flodr1">On-site</a> is an announcement "You can click, but you can't hide" with a warning that the <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/CurrentReleases/" target="_flodr1">MPAA</a> now possess the site's access logs which they are going to use to track down all those illegally sharing movies.<br /><br />However, this may be more bombast than fact. Although the site was a Torrent tracker, the only people at risk are those actively sharing downloads (seeders). If you are guilty of seeding but connect via a dynamic IP, the MPAA has to first find out the IP block owner. And the trail often goes cold when it crosses the US' territorial boundaries.<br /><br />Of course, the death of LokiTorrent doesn't mean the end of the Torrent and P2P networks. There are new Torrent sharing and search sites springing up every day. And if you've been happily downloading content for free, I recommend lying low for a while. Of course, if you prefer quibbling, the MPAA can only (legally) prosecute movie pirates. Not those ripping off music, books and software (including games). A specious argument oft used by companies to justify their buying just one legal copy of a software product, but using 10 or more copies across multiple systems.<br /><br />What's interesting that <a href="http://www.bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/" target="_flodr1">BitTorrent</a> itself is an open-source technology. That's ideally suited to sharing large files without overloading one specific server. And many of the larger, more-popular downloads including <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.0/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%201.0.exe.torrent" target="_fldwn">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a href="moox.ws/tech/mozilla/thunderbird.htm" target="_fldwn">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> and <a href="http://cwelug.org/~rwcitek/openoffice/OOo_1.1.1_Win32Intel_install.exe.torrent" target="_fldwn">OpenOffice.org</a> suite are available as .torrent.<br /><br />As a Firefox user, beware of a newly discovered IDN vulnerability. That also affects OmniWeb, Opera, Mozilla, Firefox, Camino, Konqueror, Netscape and Safari. Internet Explorer is safe. The <a href="http://www.payp&#1072;l.com/" target="_blank">IDN spoof attack</a> can be exploited by a malicious web site to spoof the URL displayed in the address, SSL certificate and status bars! The <a href="http://secunia.com/multiple_browsers_idn_spoofing_test/" target="_flodr1">Secunia Advisory: Multiple Browsers IDN Spoofing Test</a> for details. Firefox 1.1 nightly (Beta) has been patched. But Firefox 1.0 users should try the quick fix<blockquote>open about:config from the browser's address bar.<br>Locate network.enableIDN<br>Set to FALSE</blockquote>In the unlikely event this modification doesn't stay, you'll need to manually edit compreg.dat located in your Firefox profile directory. Open the file with WordPad and comment out lines containing IDN by adding a '#' at the start of the line (e.g. #{4byteshex-2byteshex-2byteshex-2byteshex-6byteshex},@mozilla.org/network/idn-service;1,,nsIDNService,rel:libnecko.so).<br /><br />But other than this minor glitches open-source is the most happening thing today. Even if you aren't a developer (cultivator) just a user (harvester) of its fruits, the breadth of applications available is staggering. For every commercial product there's a free alternative.<br /><br />One example is the excellent 7-Zip file compression format recently updated with LZMA compression technology for more optimized file packing. The 7z format includes a self-extraction option, with little loss in compressed file size. The <a href="http://www.7zip.org/" target="_flodr1">7-Zip</a> manager supports 7z (native), ZIP, CAB, RAR, ARJ, GZIP, BZIP2, Z, TAR, CPIO, RPM and DEB. And offers 2-10% better compression ratios for the ZIP and GZIP format as compared to that offered by industry-leaders PKZip and WinZip. And if you use Total Commander, there's a free 7-Zip <a href="http://www.totalcmd.net/plugring/7zip_plugin.html" target="_fldwn">plug-in</a> available.<br /><br />Another excellent open-source tool is WinSCP. This secure copy client uses SSH to safely copying files between local and remote computers. The interface is close to Norton Commander (as also to Total Commander). But its a stand alone application. File management options supported include copy, move, rename (files, folders), create new folders and change properties (files, folders). I use <a href="http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/index.php" target="_flodr1">WinSCP</a> at work to transfer files between my desktop and our production web servers. And to download transaction logs from our payment gateway.<br /><br />I think I've earlier highlighted the need to compress larger message attachments. But that was using WinZip's plug-in for Outlook. Now PowerArchiver has released its plugin. This supports not just the native .Zip format, but also 7z, CAB, TAR.GZ and SFX (self-extracting) formats. <a href="http://www.powerarchiver.com/papp/" target="_flodr1">PowerArchiver plug-in</a> also supports up to 256-bit encryption using PAE or AES. The plugin need PowerArchiver installed and works with Outlook 2000, XP and 2003.<br /><br />If you (like I) use Mozilla Thunderbird as your primary email client, there's still no plug-in to compress message attachments. Although there is the <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/" target="_flodr1">EnigMail</a> extension to encrypt messages. Perhaps its time one of the developers reading this column created a Thunderbird extension to compress message attachments. Send me a copy and I'll preview the add-in. <br /><br />Yahoo's the first search engine to release a Mozilla Firefox toolbar. This mirrors the companion bar for Internet Explorer, excluding only Anti-Spy and support for International Yahoo IDs. The <a href="http://toolbar.yahoo.com/firefox" target="_flodr1">Beta release</a> is for Windows, but Yahoo is working on Linux and Mac OS X versions. If you prefer Google, there's a community-developed extension that ports Google's IE toolbar to Firefox.<br /><br />If you are looking for a free MP3 player that's missing ad- and spyware, look no further than <strong>jetAudio 6.1.1 Basic</strong>. That natively supports MP3, OGG, MPG, AVI, WMA. With (audio CD) ripping and burning included. The player supports DVD and VCD playback, Monkeys Audio support, skins and visualizations. As well as CDDB lookup and an integrated lyrics viewer that can now search Leo's Lyric Database (requires an Internet connection). The new <a href="http://eng.iaudio.com/jetaudio/JAD6_BASIC.exe" target="_fldwn">release</a> also plays AVI and MPG files while these are downloading! The Pro version support broadcasting and mp3PRO (ripping to and playback from) formats. JetAudio is my main multimedia player.<br /><br />Troj/BankAsh-A (Trojan-Spy.Win32.Banker.jv, PWS-Banker.j) steals credit card and other stored private data. Its also the first Trojan that specifically targets Microsoft Anti-Spyware and attempts to close this application. It also attempts to close other running anti-virus programs. The Trojan also deletes files, installs a key logger. And opens a backdoor to download code and exchange information with a remote site. The Trojan spreads through an infected email attachment. Hijacks the Internet Explorer start page. And steals email login details and passwords from the browser's protected store.<br /><br />BankAsh-A drops ASH.DLL to the Windows system folder then creates a Windows Registry entry<blockquote>HKCR\CLSID\(C6176B04-8896-4446-9939-E00EE94C420F)<br>HKCR\AntiSpy.AntiSpy<br>HKCR\AntiSpy.AntiSpy.1</blockquote>. The DLL registers as an Interface "IIEHlprObj" and as Type Library "AS 0.96 Type Library". <br /><br />It also creates the registry branches<blockquote><br />HKCR\Interface\(17A45F93-AEC8-440B-AC33-1BA9CC3192AC)<br>HKCR\TypeLib\(D941DA88-1DAA-4ED2-8946-ABABCF2A4C3F)</blockquote>BankAsh-A attempts kill Microsoft AntiSpyware application. And deletes the entry "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\gcasServ" and terminates GCASCLEANER; GCASDTSERV; GCASINSTALLHELPER; GCASNOTICE; GCASSERV; GCASSERVALERT; GCASSWUPDATER; GCIPTOHOSTQUEUE; GIANTANTISPYWAREMAIN; GIANTANTISPYWAREUPDATER processes. The Trojan also deletes the %\Program Files\Microsoft AntiSpyware folder. Modifies the Windows HOSTS file. And unregisters then deletes IEHELPER.DLL from the Windows system folder.<br /><br />Luckily BankAsh-A works only for Barclay's Bank, Cahoot, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Nationwide, NatWest and Smile. When any of the latter's online banking sites are accessed, the Trojan hijacks the browser to display a fake login page. Sophos offers well-presented <a href="http://www.sophos.com/support/disinfection/trojan.html" target="_flodr1">virus removal instructions</a>.<br /><br />If you are still waiting for the so-far elusive free anti-virus, do consider ClamWin. SourceForge's <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/clamwin/" target="_flodr1">Project of the Month</a> for February 2005, this open source virus checker for Microsoft Windows combines a <a href="http://www.clamwin.com/" target="_flodr1">GUI</a> that works with a Windows32 port of the ClamAV scanning engine (previously available only for Linux, BSED, etc). It includes automatic virus database updates, a scanning scheduler with a stand alone virus scanner. It integrates into the Windows Explorer menu and works as an add-in for Microsoft Outlook. According to the developer,, ClamWin 0.37.3 was downloaded 59,000 times in under two months.<br /><br />And if you want to give something back, <em>ClamWin project desperately needs developers with Python and C++ experience with exposure to both Windows and Unix operating systems. Who can devote at least 5 hours a week. Anyone interested should send an email to alch at users dot sourceforge dot net</em>.<br /><br />That's it for this week, until next time, Stay Safe!<br />

          <span style="font-weight:bold;">Which Do You Prefer: Bagel or Sober</span><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">You don't get much choice because both are spreading in the wild. Take your mind of your troubles with a Firefox Bookmark Synchronizer and guides to optimizing Windows 2000 and Windows XP</span><br /><br />This week sees new variants of the Bagel and Sober worms. Which means you'll have to update your antivirus too as the new signatures differ quite a bit from the older ones. But the new ones will detect previous strains.<br /><br />The Bagel worm is particularly nasty and spreads via an infected email attachment pretending to be a text, screen saver or picture file. However, this virus like so many others, takes advantage of a Windows feature that hides file extensions by default; something corrected in Windows Server 2003 (and in the forthcoming Longhorn).<br /><br />Bagle.AZ (W32.Beagle.AZ@mm, W32/Bagle, Win32.Bagle.AU, Win32/Bagle.BE@mm, Win32/Bagle.CPL.Variant!Worm, Email-Worm.Win32.Bagle.ba, I-Worm.Bagle.AY, I-Worm.Bagle.at, I-Worm/Bagle.AZ, W32.Beagle.BA@mm, W32/Bagle.BC@mm, W32/Bagle.BK.worm, W32/Bagle.BK@mm, W32/Bagle.BM.worm, Win32.Bagle.AV[worm], Win32/Bagle.BD@mm, Win32:Beagle-AW, Win32:Beagle-AX) when clicked silently drops 3 copies named sysformat.exe, sysformat.exeopen, sysformat.exeopenopen -- into the Windows System folder. Then defines two Windows Registry entries.<br /><br />The first loads a copy every time Windows starts. And includes a 100-millisecond infinite loop ensuring the worm remains memory resident. The second validates how long its been since the first infection began. If the checked date is 25 days after the first infection or if the system date is April 25, 2006 or later, the worm uninstalls itself. Bagel also targets instances of the Netsky virus and deletes any registry entries associated with Worm_Netsky variants. It also adds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutex" target="_flodr1">mutexes</a> to prevent Netsky from running on Bagel-infected systems. <br /><br />Bagel also searches the computer for folders containing the string "shar" (e.g <strong>shar</strong>ed). Then drops copies of itself titled <blockquote>Ahead Nero 7.exe<br>Windows Longhorn Beta Leak.exe<br>Opera 8 New!.exe<br>XXX hardcore images.exe<br>WinAmp 6 New!.exe<br>WinAmp 5 Pro Keygen Crack Update.exe<br>Adobe Photoshop 9 full.exe<br>Matrix 3 Revolution English Subtitles.exe<br>ACDSee 9.exe</blockquote>Bagel also targets processes relating antivirus and firewalls.<br /><br />The worm also harvests email addresses from the Windows Address Book, browser caches and shared folders. Then replicates itself by sending mail to these addresses using forged headers. The worm also attempts to open a port and listen for commands from its creator. Bagel's spreading in-the-wild infecting computers running Windows 9x/ME/2000/XP/2003. <br /><br />Sober.k (W32/Sober.k@MM, W32/Sober-I, Sober.I, W32/Sober.j@mm, W32.Sober.I@MM) doesn't have real destructive capabilities. It's more an annoyance that generates vast amount of spam traffic and that doesn't exactly endear you to the recipients of its largesse. As they run the risk of being (inadvertently) infected.<br /><br />This virus arrives as an infected .PIF mail attachment. It includes its own SMTP engine. The worm will harvest your computer for email addresses. Then begins sending copies of itself to them using forged mail headers to escape detection. Sober too is spreading rapidly in the wild. Since the weekend I've been a most unwilling recipient of 1-2 mails an hour arriving in my work account. One of my customer's seems to be infected. And is "happily" blasting infected messages to everyone whose corresponded within the group! <br /><br />Watch out for anti-spyware tools that themselves are spyware! You've probably encountered a web ad banner that almost insists that your computer is infected. The ad usually displays "unknown operating system" when you use Firefox. Don't be misled. Actually using Internet Explorer (IE) is really unsafe for your cyber health. Just visit the <a href="http://gemal.dk/browserspy/" target="_flodr1">BrowserSpy</a> page hosted by <a href="http://gemal.dk/" target="_flodr1">Henrik Gemal</a>, one of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/" target="_flodr1">Thunderbird</a> development leads. THis offers a excellent collection of tools that extract information about browsing habits, system configuration and anything else your browser's willing to share!<br /><br />IE is truly the most willing to share regardless of whose asking. Most info extraction techniques use ActiveX; in itself very unsafe (I've disabled mine). But if you can't live without IE. Don't hold your breath too long. The next planned software overhaul is not going to happen until the launch of Longhorn sometime in 2006 (or later). But you might want to read about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/IE/community/columns/personalize.mspx" target="_flodr1">Personalizing Internet Explorer</a>. Written by <a href="http://inetexplorer.mvps.org/" target="_flodr1">Sandi Hardimeier</a>, a Microsoft MCP (Most-Valued Professional), the article also includes links to the Windows Marketplace's <a href="http://windowsmarketplace.com/content.aspx?ctId=63" target="_flodr1">IE Add-ons</a>.<br /><br />In my ongoing battle against spyware I use a multi-tier approach. There's Microsoft (ex-Giant) Anti-Spyware because it accesses otherwise hidden system and registry processes. Ad-Aware SE is definitely one of the most thorough scanners and can detect cookies (Microsoft's anti-cookie detectors need serious work). The free Spyware Blaster adds an extra level of protection against ActiveX control, spyware cookies and BHOs (browser helper objects). And my Trend Micro PC-Cillin Internet Security 2005 spyware scanner also monitors for anything that might slip past the others. I regrettably had to discard Spybot Search & Destroy after the application stopped responding at the end of a scan.I tried everything but sadly had to eventually remove it after one crash too many.<br /><br /><p><a href="../images/books_big.jpg" target="_pixpopup"><img border="2" src="../images/books_sm.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="Bookmark Synchonizer for Firefox"></a>As a inveterate Firefox user, I'm always on the lookout for new usable extension. And recently chanced across the  <a href="https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&version=1.0%20&os=Windows&category=Bookmarks&id=14" target="_flodr1"><strong>Bookmark Synchronizer</strong></a>extension. Accessible as sub-item on the Bookmarks menu. this extension let you store and synchronize bookmark files (in XML format) on a FTP/WebDAV server. Setup is really easy. All you need to add is the server address, your user name, password and the path and name of the XML file. Make sure to save your settings. Then upload your bookmarks file. You can download and update existing bookmarks by merging them with the remote file.<br /><br />If you are still who haven't upgraded to Windows XP. You might be interested in a free guide to <a href="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/SupportCD/Optimize2000.html" target="_flodr1">optimizing Windows 2000</a>. Its really simple to implement the many tweaks. Which cover optimizing the system cache, managing the page file as well as about disabling Windows services.
