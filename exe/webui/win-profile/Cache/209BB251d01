current page - <B>events</B><BR><BR><BR>

This is a some kind of my personal ever-growing computing-related blog/news page. It will contain current important events, personal ones, like completely new things that I have discovered, information about my current system state, un-installations, re-installations of my operating systems, any errors I am coping with lately, software updates and similar. It was started on <A HREF="#firstevent">[ <B>19.2.2005</B> ]</A> with the file-caching problem (that lead me to completely un-install my Windows XP/Pro SP1), its basic description and solution, i.e., re-installing Windows, particularly I've downgraded to non-SP version of Windows XP. Of course I've tried almost all possible solutions before. Yeah, and btw., luckily this time installation with Unattended parameters worked, but read the first "opening" entry below at the bottom of this page.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

Well yet another "must have" program a "personal caching/filtering psuedo-DNS server" called <B>DNSKong</B>. See its main and support home-pages here: <A HREF="http://www.pyrenean.com/dnsk.php>http://www.pyrenean.com/dnsk.php</A> and here: <A HREF="http://accs-net.com/hosts/DNSKong.html>http://accs-net.com/hosts/DNSKong.html</A>. Then there are also two other related sites worth mentioning, see this: <A HREF="http://www.accs-net.com/hosts>http://www.accs-net.com/hosts</A> and this:
<A HREF="http://www.pyrenean.com/inetprivacy.php>http://www.pyrenean.com/inetprivacy.php</A> site.<BR><BR>

Then to see how to configure your system to use 127.0.0.1 as the first Domain Server after installing DNSKong, see this page here: <A HREF="http://www.pacificnet.net/~bbruce/dnsw2k.htm">http://www.pacificnet.net/~bbruce/dnsw2k.htm </A>, and I recommend you to check also somehow related post of mine on ArsTechnica <B>Controlling DNS Lookup Sequence confusion (first Domain Server, etc.)</B> here: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/754001262731">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/754001262731</A> and the usual ArsTechnica <B>The "neat application I stumbled across on the web"</B> thread: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/1400961263/r/708003752731#708003752731">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/1400961263/r/708003752731#708003752731</A> on page 43.<BR><BR>

When you will browse DNSKong's pages optionally look for <B>eDexter</B> program, which is a similar program from the same author, used to replace those empty boxes that occur when you use the Hosts file to block ads, check theis: 
<A HREF="http://www.pyrenean.com/edexter.php>http://www.pyrenean.com/edexter.php</A> and this: 
>
<A HREF="http://accs-net.com/hosts/eDexter.html>http://accs-net.com/hosts/eDexter.html</A> link. They are both programs both running as a local-only HTTP servers, and heh, they are both available also in the "no-setup" form.<BR><BR><BR>

<I><B>29.3.2005</B></I><BR><BR>

Today I added the <B>Fred Langa's Newsletter</B> banner to the pages under <I>main pages</I> section (except for the terms and articles), which are designed in the same manner, i.e., I added it to those pages with the table element with "NAVIGATION" bar and "PREFACE TEXT". Anyway, see few related links, first the main page of Langa Newsletter site: <A HREF="http://www.langa.com/newsletter.htm">http://www.langa.com/newsletter.htm</A>, and then two banner-related pages: <A HREF="http://langa.com/code.htm">http://langa.com/code.htm</A> and this: <A HREF="http://langa.com/link.txt">http://langa.com/link.txt</A>. So in general Langa Newsletter is a FREE and SPAM-PROOF award-winning e-newsletter, and its main "mission" is offering users to "<I>get LOTS more from their hardware, software, and time online</I>". Honstly, one of the reasons that I put this banner on my site is a wish that also my site will get more traffic. So that's about it - subscribe to the e-newsletter and see for yourself.<BR><BR><BR>

<I><B>25.3.2005</B></I><BR><BR>

How handy that right after the sad news that Mozilla Foundation has discontinued .zip files as a major releases, I totally by chance found the <B>Off By One</B> web browser when I was reading particularly the Firefox review on CastleCops site - the software-reviews page: <A HREF="http://castlecops.com/reviews.html">http://castlecops.com/reviews.html</A>. Please just don't hesitate and go to the Off By One program's main site: <A HREF="http://OffByOne.com">http://OffByOne.com</A>. Also see the <B>Off By One Web Browser</B> thread, I opened on ArsTechnica forums: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/872004842731">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/872004842731</A>. Now I see that I will certainly use it as a "supplemental" browser in the future because obviously <B>it is meant for as private surfing as possible by default</B> because of all the missing features (Javascript/ActiveX support) compare to other browsers but especially because of the way of caching, i.e., memory-resident caching, see below. Ehm, beside that it is pretty fast and well that it's a "non-setup" program.<BR><BR>

Taken from the program's web-site: <B>How are pages, images and cookies cached?</B><BR><BR>

<I><B>The page cache and image cache are memory-resident and utilize no disk storage, so they disappear without a trace at the end of a browsing session. Persistent HTTP cookies are stored across sessions in the file HPSW.CKI, which may be safely deleted between sessions for maximum privacy.</B></I><BR><BR>

Surely I can also set Firefox or Internet Explorer to cache the history of visited pages for 0 days and set the max. size for temporary files to 0 KB, but for the usual day-to-day surfing (sites that I know well and visit frequently, or those that I do not yet know, but I assume they are trust-worthy), this would be totally non-practical. Oh yes, I can create a special Firefox's profile configured like this, but I already have one default profile (that I use most of the time), then one profile set only to use it with Proxomitron, and in the end one set as a "backup" profile (containing my old huge bookmarks), so I certainly do not want to create another profile just for that, but also I prefer that OffByOne browser operates like this by default.<BR><BR><BR>

<I><B>23.3.2005</B></I><BR><BR>A really sad day for us, who are obsessed with "non-setup" type of applications. Yesterday, when I browsed the Mozilla Foundation FTP-server (after noticing that Thunderbird was updated to version 1.0.2), I searched for the zipped package without luck. Then I thought it is just because the newest release is fresh, and that zip variant will be added later, but I was wrong. And the saddest thing is that not only Thunderbird, but Firefox also. See the reason why Mozilla Foundation devs have decided that they will discontinue issuing zipped packages for major releases on <B>Chase's blog - Wondering why there are no .zip files for the Fx and Tb 1.0.2 releases?</B>: <A HREF="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/chase/archives/2005/03/wondering_why_t.html">http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/chase/archives/2005/03/wondering_why_t.html</A>, I can say that it is without any doubt a rather banal reason. Also see the <B>Will be Thunderbird 1.0.2 available in .zip package ??</B> thread: <A HREF="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=239047">http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=239047</A>, I opened on MozillaZine forums (you can see that many users are disappointed and complaining), and the <B>From the 1.0.2 release on, Thunderbird will NOT be available in zip package anymore</B> topic: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/742005342731">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/742005342731</A>, I opened on ArsTechnica forums on the very same day.<BR><BR><BR>

<I><B>22.3.2005</B></I><BR><BR>I am very proud and happy to announce, that my site is now an "official" supporter of The Missions Network project. I was contacted by e-mail from one of the <B>The Missions Network</B> site's organisers, because I have a banner on my main pages (the ones with NAVIGATION bar structured with table element), linking to thier site for quite some time. Well, or because I've sent a request to join the Network, I am really not sure. See the main page of The Missions Network's site here: <A HREF="http://network.readyresponse.org">http://network.readyresponse.org</A>, or the same index-page: <A HREF="http://network.readyresponse.org/index.php">http://network.readyresponse.org/index.php</A>, but also see the page with all the affiliates listed (my site is listed as "Tadej's Homepage"): <A HREF="http://network.readyresponse.org/index.php?item=affiliates">http://network.readyresponse.org/index.php?item=affiliates</A>. So yeah, now my site will "officially" help to spread the information about the existance of the mentioned project/site and current site's missions/proposals, which you can by-the-way see in the "cell" on the right side of so-called PREFACE SECTION (ehm, only on those sites that have ehm, NAVIGATION bar structured with table element). Optionally you can also check their main "sister-site" <B>Readyresponse</B> (https link): <A HREF="https://www.readyresponse.org">https://www.readyresponse.org</A>, same as above the index-page (http link): <A HREF="http://www.readyresponse.org/index.php">http://www.readyresponse.org/index.php</A>, with forums and hosting lots of other projects' stuff, including Distributed Computing projects teams and similar.<BR><BR><BR>

<I><B>19.3.2005</B></I><BR><BR>

An awesome <B>Winroll</B> program: <A HREF="http://www.palma.com.au/winroll">http://www.palma.com.au/winroll</A>, which simply rolls any window to its header (and supports transparency). I first haven't used it myself because I use Blackbox for Windows as my OS-shell, which offers so-called "workspaces", i.e., virtual desktops (and therefore there was no need to), but thanks to abc123 user on ArsTechnica forums (he started using it because I've recommended it), see the <B>The "neat application I stumbled across on the web" thread</B>, page 43: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/1400961263/p/43">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/1400961263/p/43</A>, I re-discovered this little gem few days back. It's a compact "non-setup" only 15 KB in-lenght FREEWARE and OPEN SOURCE application, coded in assembly.<BR><BR><BR>

<I><B>14.3.2005</B></I><BR><BR>

I've found yet another useful program called <B>Ntregopt</B>, which is somehow similar "non-setup" program to <B>Pagedfrg</B> program from Sysinternals, see: <A HREF="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pagedefrag.shtml">http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pagedefrag.shtml</A>, though it optimizes only the registry hives, and doesn't touch pagefile and services' logfiles at all (file with .evt extension), and also you need to run it just before booting so it doesn't run after boot like pagedfrg. See the links to its home-page here: <A HREF="http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de">http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de</A> and here: <A HREF="http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/index.htm">http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/index.htm</A>, and optionally also 
see my post in the usual ArsTechnica <B>The "neat application I stumbled across on the web"</B> thread on page 43: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/1400961263/r/499003422731#499003422731">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/1400961263/r/499003422731#499003422731</A><BR><BR>

/EDIT: from program's home-page:<BR><BR>

<I><B>The program works by recreating each registry hive "from scratch", thus removing any slack space that may be left from previously modified or deleted keys. Note that the program does NOT change the contents of the registry in any way, nor does it physically defrag the registry files on the drive (as the PageDefrag program from SysInternals does). The optimization done by NTREGOPT is simply compacting the registry hives to the minimum size possible.</B></I><BR><BR>

Then there is also an <B>Erunt</B> program on the same site. It is used to backup the registry, while I especially like its sub-program <B>Autoback</B> (a commandline program), contained in the same .zip archive as Erunt. It's very handy to set it to backup registry on/after boots, i.e., I've put it to <I>All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\</I> directory, so that it backups registry nomather with which account I logon.<BR><BR><BR>

<I><B>7.3.2005</B></I><BR><BR>

I've just discovered a new programming language and environment for personal computers. It's called simply <B>ABC</B>, it has a collection of only 5 data types and it was originally intended as a replacement for BASIC. It was designed by first doing a task analysis of the programming task. See the topic I opened on ArsTechnica titled as <B>ABC programming language</B> in this thread: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/6330927813/m/444008902731/r/101000412731">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/6330927813/m/444008902731/r/101000412731</A>, but also check the ABC's home-pages with clicking on this link here: <A HREF="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/abc">http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/abc</A>, then here: <A HREF="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/abc/implementations.html">http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/abc/implementations.html</A>, here: <A HREF="http://www.answers.com/topic/abc-programming-language">http://www.answers.com/topic/abc-programming-language</A> and finally here: <A HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/archive/projects/abc.html">http://www.cwi.nl/archive/projects/abc.html</A><BR><BR>

Some features of the language (from the program home-page):<BR><BR>

<I><B>a powerful collection of only 5 data types that can easily be combined strong typing, yet without declarations no limitations (such as max int), apart from sheer exhaustion of memory refinements to support top-down programming nesting by indentation programs typically one fourth or one fifth the size of the equivalent Pascal or C.</B></I><BR><BR> 

Some features of the environment (from the program home-page):<BR><BR>

<I><B>no need for files: procedures and functions and global variables remain after logging out one consistent face is shown to the user at all times, whether executing commands, editing, or entering input to a program generalized undo mechanism.</B></I><BR><BR>

I have become quite familiar with it in the last month. The whole .zip package is only 605 KB in lenght, and oh yeah - this one also comes without an installer (compare to Python or Ruby), so you only need to do two very simple things. First you need to edit a few lines in the <I>abc.bat</I> file (it's used to launch the ABC's "workspace", i.e., interpreter), and second you need to edit the <I>ABCxp.lnk</I> shortcut's properties to corespond to your particular situation. Hehe - that's why I also call my Linux Slackware - Zipslack distribution a "non-setup" operating system, i.e., because you only need to edit one line in the <I>linux.bat</I> file (the 'root=/dev/XXXX' one in particular), to boot to the correct partition where Linux is located.<BR><BR><BR>

I discovered this awsome feature from this site: <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com">http://tinyurl.com</A> called TinyURL. With it, you can shorten any long URL for more than 80 % in some cases. I will add an this feature box to all my pages soon. So I am very grateful to Arsian (a member of ArsTechnica forums), and his home page with a bunch of programs, related to Distributed Computing projects: <A HREF="http://www.bluetentacle.co.uk">http://www.bluetentacle.co.uk</A>, to discover this TinyURL thingy at all.<BR><BR><BR>

Mozilla Foundation today released the Firefox version 1.0.1. In one sentence: <I>A minor update, this version fixes a few security holes and some other bugs. If you're using Firefox 1.0, you want this release.</I>, as stated on MozillaZine Talkback's site:<A HREF="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6129">http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6129</A>, but also you can check the "official" topic on ArsTechnica <B>Firefox 1.0.1 out, squashes most security bugs</B>: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/174096756/m/664003420731">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/174096756/m/664003420731</A>, and my topic: <B>Mozilla Firefox 1.0.1 was released</B>: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/806006220731">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/a/tpc/f/99609816/m/806006220731</A>, which I opened earlier (when sorting Firefox's "LiveMarks", I checked that link, which I usually I don't)<BR><A NAME="firstevent"></A><BR><BR>

<I><B>19.2.2005</B></I><BR><BR>

First, check this topic on ArsTechnica <B>System file cache is almost empty all the time</B>: 
<A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;f=99609816&amp;m=413004259631&amp;r=413004259631">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;f=99609816&amp;m=413004259631&amp;r=413004259631</A>, so as you see, the problem was that my System file cache is almost empty all the time. I've noticed this with Cacheset application from Sysinternals (and confirmed with Iarsn's Abpmon). The file cache's current size was between 400 and 1500 KB most of the time (or 0 % and only some times temporarly 1 % in Abpmon). After some program was launched, etc. it jumped to near 1500 KB (rarely above), but then I suppose something "flushed" the cached data back to files/disk instantly. And later on, I discovered that sometimes it appeared as it was the opposite/reversed, it was growing till I executed some new program (or performed some action in already running ones), and then something "emptied" it. Before that, it would grow endlessly, i.e., till the RAM would be full, and therefor it was just too annoying, because it surely causes a general delay in various aspects of overall system performance. For example browsing through directories was much slower/delayed, playing a game was almoust impossible, opening/closing programs and performing any task with them was much slower, etc.<BR><BR>

As mentioned, this problem was the reason, that I have finally done it yesterday, i.e., I un-installed my Windows XP/Pro SP1 and installed the good old non-SP Windows XP/Pro, and everything is fine now. The delays caused by screwed caching were just too annoying, for example browsing through directories was slower, playing a game was almoust impossible, opening/closing programs and performing any task with them was much slower, etc. Of course, before that (re-installing), I checked the file-caching on my Windows 98/SE setup on the same computer, to be sure it is not RAM related. And it was caching just normally. But the most important thing is that I actually installed it with the <B>Unattended parameters</B>, i.e., I changed the default locaton of user-profile, so now it is not <B>Documents and Settings</B> anymore, but only <I><B>Settings</B></I>. For the detailed information, see the related topics on ArsTechnica <B>Why the hell Unattended parameter wasn't applied on installation ??</B>: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;f=99609816&amp;m=485007538631&amp;r=485007538631">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;f=99609816&amp;m=485007538631&amp;r=485007538631</A>, <B>Changing "Documents and Settings" folder location threa</B>: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;f=99609816&amp;m=805001836631&amp;r=805001836631">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;f=99609816&amp;m=805001836631&amp;r=805001836631</A>, <B>Changing the location of Documents and Settings when installing XP</B>: <A HREF="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;f=12009443&amp;m=897005456631&amp;r=543008456631">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;f=12009443&amp;m=897005456631&amp;r=543008456631</A> and here on Winforums <B>Moving Documents and Settings Folder</B>: <A HREF="http://forums.winforums.org/showthread.php?p=36049">http://forums.winforums.org/showthread.php?p=36049</A>. Well, the thing is that the last time I've tried (on previous attempt to install Windows with the Unattended parameters), there were missing lines (particularly the [Data] header), so because of the wrong syntax of Winnt.sif file that I used, it just didn't work. Also as usual, I changed the <B>Program Files</B> variable with TweakUI program, to point to another partiton (where non-setups already are), and to <I><B>Programs</B></I> directory instead, I even changed the Common Files variable to point to flder named <I><B>Common</B></I> (note the 8 chars long file-names in all cases), so I have all my programs on one and strictly Windows files on another partition nicely separated for the first time ever. I would even use another disk for pagefile, but I am a bit afraid, because it is the one that was badly corrupted.<BR><BR><BR><BR>
