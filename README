SUPPORT
=======
This is an early release of the eXe project.  It is intended
to elicit feedback from the user community. 
It would be a bad idea to invest a lot of time in creating a 
large package with this release.

If you have any problems or have any feedback please report them at
http://exe.cfdl.auckland.ac.nz or email exe@auckland.ac.nz.


KNOWN BUGS
==========
See http://exe.cfdl.auckland.ac.nz/mantis for the eXe issue list.


WINDOWS
=======

INSTALLATION
------------
- Download exe_install_windows.exe and double click it then follow the instructions. 
- You will be asked what directory to install eXe in.  The default will normally
  be fine.
- The installer will create an eXe icon on the desktop and a menu-item under 
  "All Programs".
- If you leave "Run eXe 0.6" selected the installer will launch eXe
  once it is installed.


RUNNING
-------
Double click on the shortcut on the desktop to launch eXe.

A window with "Welcome to eXe: the eLearning XML editor" and a Firefox browser
will start.  To close eXe you will need to exit both of these.  Remember to
save your content before exiting.

The first time you run you may get asked if you want to allow eXe
to access the Internet.  eXe does NOT require access to the Internet.
With the XP firewall you can just select the option to block its access.
With the McAfee firewall you will need to allow access.

MAC OSX
=======

Creating a Mac install is something we're still working towards.  
For the technically inclined we're working towards using PyXPCOM
to replace the Nevow library which should simplify a Mac version.

We have had earlier versions of eXe running on Mac, but we've run into
multiple problems with later releases.  I'm not sure if you're
interested in the details, but they were...
 * Nevow the XMLHTTP library we use gives connection errors just on
   Mac, even though it is supposed to support Mac.  We're looking
   at replacing XMLHTTP/Nevow with PyXPCOM.
 * Mac applications only have one menu bar, we need to replace the 
   Firefox menubar, but when doing that (by turning off Firefox
   chrome) we get another error with FCKEditor (the rich text
   editor we're using) flickering.  We're investigating possibly
   replacing    FCKEditor by using Mozilla's "native" Midas editing 
   interface.
 * We also have more work to do on how to create a install package for
   eXe on the Mac.  We're aiming to use PyApp for this.

LINUX
=====

The eXe Linux install consists of two RPMs which have been tested
to work on Fedora Core 3.  (They may work on other RPM based distros
but that hasn't been tested.)

* exe-0.6-1.noarch.rpm - includes the eXe editor and bundled Firefox
* exe-twisted-2.0-1.noarch.rpm - includes Twisted, ZopeInterface and Nevow used for the webserver by eXe

From the command line type exe to start.
Make sure Firefox is closed first.
