KNOWN BUGS
==========
See http://exelearning.org/projects/exe1 for the eXe issue list.


WINDOWS
=======

INSTALLATION
------------
- Download exe_install_windows.exe and double click it then follow the
  instructions. 
- You will be asked what directory to install eXe in.  The default will
  normally be fine.
- The installer will create an eXe icon on the desktop and a menu-item under
  "All Programs".

RUNNING
-------
Double click on the shortcut on the desktop to launch eXe.

A window with "Welcome to eXe: the eLearning XML editor" and a Firefox browser
will start.  To close eXe you will need to exit both of these.  Remember to
save your content before exiting.

The first time you run you may get asked if you want to allow eXe
to access the Internet.  eXe does NOT require access to the Internet.
With the XP firewall you can just select the option to block its access.
With the McAfee firewall you will need to allow access.


MAC OSX
=======

The Mac OSX version of eXe is still experimental and should be considered
unstable.

To install it, simply drag the app to your Applications folder.


FEDORA LINUX 
=============

The eXe Fedora Linux install consists of two RPMs which have been tested
to work on Fedora Core 4.  (They may work on other RPM based distros
but that hasn't been tested.)

* exe-0.15-1.noarch.rpm - includes the eXe editor and bundled Firefox
* exe-twisted-2.0-1.noarch.rpm - includes Twisted, ZopeInterface and Nevow used for the webserver by eXe

From the command line type exe to start.


UBUNTU LINUX 
============

The eXe Ubuntu Linux install consists of 
* python2.4-exe_0.20.1-0.1ubuntu1_all.deb

Add:
