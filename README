SUPPORT
=======
This is an early (the first!) release of the eXe project.  It is intended
to elicit feedback from the user community.  We expect file formats will
change.  It would be a bad idea to invest a lot of time in creating a 
large package with this release. This release is just for playing.

If you have any problems or have any feedback please post them on the Eduforge
forum https://eduforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=284 or email them to
d.moore@auckland.ac.nz. 

REQUIREMENTS
============
The interface for eXe requires the Mozilla Firefox browser.  (This can be
downloaded from http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox).  You do not
need to set Firefox as your default browser (but it doesn't hurt ;-) ).

WINDOWS
=======

INSTALLATION
------------
- Download exe-0.1.223.msi and double click it then follow the instructions. 
- You will be asked what directory to install eXe in.  The default will normally
  be fine.
- The installer will create an eXe icon on the desktop and a menu-item under 
  "All Programs".


RUNNING
-------
Double click on the shortcut on the desktop to launch eXe.

A window with "Welcome to eXe: the eLearning XML editor" and a Firefox browser
will start.  To close eXe you will need to exit both of these.  Remember to
save your content before exiting.

The first time you run you may get asked if you want to allow eXe
to access the Internet.  eXe does NOT require access to the Internet,
just select the option to block its access.

Packages are saved to your "My Documents" folder with the .elp extension 
(eXe eLearning Package).


LINUX
=====
These instructions are tailored for Windows users.  eXe does work on Linux
as well, but does not have an automated installer.  Linux users will need
to untar the source files and have Python 2.3.4 (http://python.org) and 
Twisted 1.3.0 (http://twistedmatrix.com) installed.


KNOWN BUGS
==========
- I you have changed content on the Authoring page and change to another page
  without clicking on a Done (green tick) the changes will be lost.
- I you have changed the fields on the Properties page and change to another page
  without clicking on a Done the changes will be lost.
- The Outline Pane in the Control Panel has problems with large trees - we're
  working on it!  If you know XUL please contact us!

Have a nice day!
