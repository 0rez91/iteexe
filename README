KNOWN BUGS
==========
See http://exelearning.org/projects/exe1 for the eXe issue list.


WINDOWS
=======

INSTALLATION
------------
- Download eXe-install-X.YY.exe, double click it to launch the installer,
  and then follow the instructions. 
- You will be asked what directory to install eXe in.  The default will
  normally be fine.  (You should always use the same directory when
  installing a new version of eXe.)
- The installer will create an eXe icon on the desktop and a menu-item under
  "All Programs".

RUNNING
-------
Double click on the shortcut on the desktop to launch eXe.

To close eXe you must use the File... Quit menu item.  Do not simply try
to close the eXe display window with the window close button.  Remember to
save your content before exiting.

The first time you run you may get asked if you want to allow eXe
to access the Internet.  eXe does NOT require access to the Internet.
With the XP firewall you can just select the option to block its access.
With the McAfee firewall you will need to allow access.


MAC OSX
=======

To install eXe, simply drag the app to your Applications folder.


FEDORA LINUX 
=============

The eXe Fedora Linux install consists of a single RPM.  There are separate
RPMs for Fedora Core 6 (Python 2.4) and Fedora 7 (Python 2.5).  Each of
these RPMs requires python-zope-interface (version 3.0.1 or newer) and
python imaging (version 1.1.5 or newer).
These RPMs might work on other RPM based Linux distributions, but that
hasn't been tested.

From the command line type exe to start.  If you are using a standard
window manager, you should find an eXe entry in your Accessories menu.


UBUNTU LINUX 
============

There are separate DPKGs for Dapper/Edgy (Python 2.4) and Feisty (Python
2.5).

From the command line type exe to start.
