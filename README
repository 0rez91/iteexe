SUPPORT
=======
This is an early release of the eXe project.  It is intended
to elicit feedback from the user community.  We expect file formats will
change.  It would be a bad idea to invest a lot of time in creating a 
large package with this release.

If you have any problems or have any feedback please report them at
http://exe.cfdl.auckland.ac.nz or email exe@auckland.ac.nz.


WINDOWS
=======

INSTALLATION
------------
- Download exeinstall.exe and double click it then follow the instructions. 
- You will be asked what directory to install eXe in.  The default will normally
  be fine.
- The installer will create an eXe icon on the desktop and a menu-item under 
  "All Programs".
- If you leave "Run eXe 0.3" selected the installer will launch eXe
  once it is installed.


RUNNING
-------
Double click on the shortcut on the desktop to launch eXe.

A window with "Welcome to eXe: the eLearning XML editor" and a Firefox browser
will start.  To close eXe you will need to exit both of these.  Remember to
save your content before exiting.

The first time you run you may get asked if you want to allow eXe
to access the Internet.  eXe does NOT require access to the Internet.
With the XP firewall you can just select the option to block its access.
With the McAfee firewall you will need to allow access.

Packages are saved to your "My Documents" folder with the .elp extension 
(eXe eLearning Package).


Have a nice day!
