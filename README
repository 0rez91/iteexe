Welcome to eXe: eLearning XML editor

Unzip the package
Run server.exe 

The first time you run you may get asked if you want to allow eXe
to access the internet.  eXe does NOT require access to the internet,
just select the option to block its access.

If Firefox is not your default browser, open Firefox and load the
URL http://localhost:8081.

This is a pre-release (0.1.183).  The interface will be changing.
We only support Firefox for the browser.  This will not render
well in Internet Explorer.  We have limited functionality.  
There are bugs.  

Have a nice day!
