SUPPORT
=======
This is an early alpha release of the eXe project.  It is intended
to elicit feedback from the user community. 
It would be a bad idea to invest a lot of time in creating a 
large package with this release.

If you have any problems or have any feedback please report them at
http://exe.cfdl.auckland.ac.nz or email exe@auckland.ac.nz.


KNOWN BUGS
==========
* We do not replace the Firefox main menu which means there are two
  menu bars.  eXe's menu bar is the bottom one.
* You cannot run a normal Firefox browser and eXe at the same time
  You must close Firefox before starting eXe and close eXe before 
  browsing the Web.
* If we have a package open, then trying to open a second package 
  (by dbl clicking on it) fails with the message "No such resource".
* The emphasis setting in the iDevice editor is ignored
* Can't delete or edit user-defined iDevices
* eXe sometimes stop responding, try clicking on the Refresh button when 
  this happens
* Our SCORM export works ok for transferring content, but still has some
  problems for tracking students.  Separate SCORM export options are
  provided for WebCT and Blackboard due to problems encountered in
  importing our standard SCORM packages into those system.


WINDOWS
=======

INSTALLATION
------------
- Download exeinstall.exe and double click it then follow the instructions. 
- You will be asked what directory to install eXe in.  The default will normally
  be fine.
- The installer will create an eXe icon on the desktop and a menu-item under 
  "All Programs".
- If you leave "Run eXe 0.4" selected the installer will launch eXe
  once it is installed.


RUNNING
-------
Double click on the shortcut on the desktop to launch eXe.

A window with "Welcome to eXe: the eLearning XML editor" and a Firefox browser
will start.  To close eXe you will need to exit both of these.  Remember to
save your content before exiting.

The first time you run you may get asked if you want to allow eXe
to access the Internet.  eXe does NOT require access to the Internet.
With the XP firewall you can just select the option to block its access.
With the McAfee firewall you will need to allow access.

MAC OSX
=======

Creating a Mac install is something we're still working towards.  
For the technically inclined we're working towards using PyXPCOM
to replace the Nevow library which should simplify a Mac version.


LINUX
=====

The eXe Linux install consists of two RPMs which have been tested
to work on Fedora Core 3.  (They may work on other RPM based distros
but that hasn't been tested.)

* exe-0.4-1.noarch.rpm - includes the eXe editor and bundled Firefox
* exe-twisted-2.0-1.noarch.rpm - includes Twisted, ZopeInterface and Nevow used for the webserver by eXe

From the command line type exe to start.
Make sure Firefox is closed first.

# config file to make it run from our projects directory
# Insert these lines in the server section
webDir = /myprojectsdir/exe/exe/webui
