PyGtkMoz 
Gtk Mozilla Embeddings for Python

Special thanks to the mozilla team, especially those that
helped and answered my stupid questions from time to time.

Specific thanks to the contributers of gtkembedmoz which
made this library possible.

What's required?
--------------------------------------------------------------

You must have the following to install pygtkmoz:
	1. Mozilla Headers and Libraries
	2. PyGtk headers, libraries, and module

This shouldn't be a problem for most systems if the -dev
packages are installed. 


How do I install?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Run "make"
Run "python ./setup.py install"

The module should be installed. Test it by running 
"example.py".


What is this?
--------------------------------------------------------------

This is a small python library that enables you to embed a 
mozilla widget inside of a Python Gtk window. If you desired,
it'd even be possible to build your own python based web browser,
although why you'd do such a thing is beyond me. 


Does this include PyXpCom?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, no.  I am researching the possibility of integration
with pyxpcom, so that you have more power over the browser widget,
and can do more interesting things. I might also seperate out
the XpCom stuff into C++, and provide an API that allows you
to control most browser functionality.  Stay Tuned for details!


I found a bug, what do I do now?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Email me a patch: andrew@textux.com

Note: I generally don't pay much attention to the sourceforge
site, so patches posted there may go ignored for sometime!
