eXe Packaging Test  2004-12-22
===============================

This is a little test of packaging a web server together with a small Python
test script, as a standalone program for use on Windows.

To Install:  
------------
Simply unzip the PACKTEST.ZIP file on your computer

To Start:      
Double click on the PACKTEST.EXE file.  
A window should appear with the message "Welcome to the eXe: packtest"
Hopefully (if file associations are set up) your browser will bring up the
test script page If it doesn't, then point your browser to
  http://localhost:8080
No Internet connectivity is required - everything is running OFFLINE on your
box

The Test:
----------
The test script is an early experiment in adding content to a page.  (Yes the
interface is very crude at the moment.  We are waiting for our web expert to
return from holiday ;-) ) 
To add a section click the Add button
A block appears which allows you to enter a title and content
More blocks can be added with the Add button
The block can be viewed by pushing Done, or removed with Delete
Have a play. Have fun!!!

Technologies:
--------------
The technologies we are using are:

Py2Exe - http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/
Creates our 3.8Mb package

Twisted - http://twistedmatrix.com/products/web
Provides our webserver

Python - http://python.org  
Is our programming language

Questions?:
------------
